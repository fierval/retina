    "Image texture strength is typically proportional to the local surface\n",
    "illumination so this compression helps to reduce the effects of local\n",
    "shadowing and illumination variations.</p>\n",
    "<p>The second stage computes first order image gradients. These capture\n",
    "contour, silhouette and some texture information, while providing\n",
    "further resistance to illumination variations. The locally dominant\n",
    "colour channel is used, which provides colour invariance to a large\n",
    "extent. Variant methods may also include second order image derivatives,\n",
    "which act as primitive bar detectors - a useful feature for capturing,\n",
    "e.g. bar like structures in bicycles and limbs in humans.</p>\n",
    "<p>The third stage aims to produce an encoding that is sensitive to\n",
    "local image content while remaining resistant to small changes in\n",
    "pose or appearance. The adopted method pools gradient orientation\n",
    "information locally in the same way as the SIFT [2]\n",
    "feature. The image window is divided into small spatial regions,\n",
    "called &quot;cells&quot;. For each cell we accumulate a local 1-D histogram\n",
    "of gradient or edge orientations over all the pixels in the\n",
    "cell. This combined cell-level 1-D histogram forms the basic\n",

    "divides the gradient angle range into a fixed number of\n",
    "predetermined bins. The gradient magnitudes of the pixels in the\n",
    "cell are used to vote into the orientation histogram.</p>\n",
    "<p>The fourth stage computes normalisation, which takes local groups of\n",
    "cells and contrast normalises their overall responses before passing\n",
    "to next stage. Normalisation introduces better invariance to illumination,\n",
    "shadowing, and edge contrast. It is performed by accumulating a measure\n",
    "of local histogram &quot;energy&quot; over local groups of cells that we call\n",
    "&quot;blocks&quot;. The result is used to normalise each cell in the block.\n",
    "Typically each individual cell is shared between several blocks, but\n",
    "its normalisations are block dependent and thus different. The cell\n",
